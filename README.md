Our group chose a dataset that contains information about ~300,000 Kickstarter projects. 
With Kickstarter being such a popular crowd-funding website, it is interesting to see what 
makes a certain project stand out and be successful. The dataset we chose has many variables 
that we can analyse in order for us to get an insight into this question. Factors such as if 
the project is for something local (a restaurant, for example) or if the project is something 
that could be enjoyed by anyone are of interest. Do local projects get less funding because 
there are fewer backers who would benefit from a successful funding? Or did these local backers 
contribute more because they saw more personal value in the project? There are many such 
questions that can be asked from such a comprehensive dataset. We hope to answer any questions 
or insights we may have by analysing this dataset.

{Our dataset is based on the kickstarter fundraisers which have over 300,000 kickstarter 
projects. Kickstarter is an independent company that provides support to the world of
creative projects initiated by the public community. The overall 300,000 kickstarter data
was provided/combined by MICKAËL MOUILLÉ initially collected from kickstarter projects.
There are around 300,000 rows and 16 columns of various data/projects which include categories 
such as poetry, drinks, food, games/crafts, sports and much more. They have listed their goals 
(up to date on how much), pledged currency, main categories, country, date launched/deadline
 and currency to fund these projects. The data was collected from the years 2009 - 2018 for 
the various projects.The purpose of this data is to acknowledge different successfull/unsuccessful
projects and which idea or project is the most common within the dataset, and if it has reached
its milestone. The dataset was initially created as a standpoint for a twitter bot to tweet
everytime a project had reached its desired milestone and for public interest to expand upon
The data was collected by a human who is a kickstarter crowdfunding enthusiast developing ideas
for these projects for the future such as apps, websites, etc.}
